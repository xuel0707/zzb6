use_cache: true                                             # whether to use the cache management of Hugging Face datasets. It might take up lots of disk space when using cache

In default, it\'s the same as the environment variable `HF_DATASETS_CACHE`, whose default value is usually "~/.cache/huggingface/datasets". If this argument is set to a valid path by users, it will override the default cache dir
open_monitor: true                                          # Whether to open the monitor to trace resource utilization for each OP during data processing. It\'s True in default.
use_checkpoint: false                                       # whether to use the checkpoint management to save the latest version of dataset to work dir when processing. Rerun the same config will reload the checkpoint and skip ops before it. Cache will be disabled when using checkpoint. If args of ops before the checkpoint are changed, all ops will be rerun from the beginning.
temp_dir: null                                              # the path to the temp directory to store intermediate caches when cache is disabled, these cache files will be removed on-the-fly. In default, it's None, so the temp dir will be specified by system. NOTICE: you should be caution when setting this argument because it might cause unexpected program behaviors when this path is set to an unsafe directory.
open_tracer: false                                            # whether to open the tracer to trace the changes during process. It might take more time when opening tracer

trace_num: 10                                               # number of samples to show the differences between datasets before and after each op. Only available when tracer is opened.
op_fusion: false                                            # whether to fuse operators that share the same intermediate variables automatically. Op fusion might reduce the memory requirements slightly but speed up the whole process.
cache_compress: null                                        # the compression method of the cache file, which can be specified in ['gzip', 'zstd', 'lz4']. If this parameter is None, the cache file will not be compressed. We recommend you turn on this argument when your input dataset is larger than tens of GB and your disk space is not enough.
